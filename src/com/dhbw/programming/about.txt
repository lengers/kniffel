This project was created as an assignment for four students 
of the DHBW Mannheim, DE.


It implements a simple version of the game Yahtzee.


To play, select the number of players (and, if you wish, 
the amount of bots to compete with), change their names by 
clicking in the right column of the player table, and click 
start to begin.
Rules of the game and further instructions are available once 
the game has begun.
